# Ants : first dev project

Ant Colony Simulation

Ants can be seen as an incredible multi-agent system, composed of very simple individuals, yet it can transform its ecosystem in a complex and fascinating way.
This project aims to reproduce this multi-agent system, from the begining of a colony to the full expansion of this system

Project temporarily stopped. Restructuration and refactoring needed
